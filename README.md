# Smart-Lamp

Energy-efficient ESP32-powered smart lamp that combines sensor data, machine learning, and user behaviour patterns to create the perfect lighting experience.

### âœ¨ Core Functionality
  * Predictive Behavior - Learns user patterns and anticipates lighting needs
  * Deep Sleep - Ultra low power mode when idle
  * Time-based Logic - Adjusts brightness levels throughout the day
  * Real-time Sensor Integration - Motion detection, ambient light sensing, and manual controls
  * IR Remote Control - Complete control (power ON/OFF, brightness adjustment, dimming)
  * Automatic Adaptive Lighting - Intelligent behaviour based on ambient conditions, time of day, and room occupancy

### Hardware:
  * ESP32 Dev Board
  * PIR Motion Sensor
  * LDR Sensor
  * IR Receiver and Remote (38KHz)
  * LED Lamp or light module

### How It Works
 1) Manual control through IR remote (on/off, brightness).
 2) Automatic control kicks in if no manual override:
    * Lamp stays off if room is bright enough.
    * Lamp turns on when dark and motion is detected.
    * Time-based logic adjusts brightness levels throughout the day.
 3) Deep Sleep Mode allows ultra-low power operation when user wants the lamp inactive.
 4) The lamp will learns usage patterns and adapts lighting automatically overtime.

### Roadmap
- [x] IR Remote Control
- [x] PIR + LDR + Time-based auto control
- [x] Basic pattern learning
- [x] Deep Sleep mode
- [ ] MQTT for remote monitoring

### Future Goals
  * Decrease the amount of program storage space used (currently 73%)
  * Increase robustness and error handling
  * Add MQTT for cloud logging and monitoring
  * Design Custom PCB with aggressive anti-noise properties
  * Design housing
