# Smart-Lamp

A Raspberry Pi Pico and ESP32-based smart lamp that learns user behavior to predictively control lighting using motion, ambient light, and time of day.

âœ¨ Features

  * Real-time data collection (motion, ambient light, manual toggles)
  * Time-based patterns (learns when you usually turn on the lamp)
  * Predictive automation (turns on lights before you enter the room)
  * Adaptive brightness (adjusts based on ambient light and habits)

ðŸ›  Setup

  ## 1) Hardware:

  Raspberry Pi Pico
  ESP32
  HR-S04 (I don't have a PIR sensor)
  LDR
  Buttons

  ## 2) Data Collection

  Sensor data is gathered by the raspberry pi pico and sent over USB Serial (UART), coded in c/c++
  
    Serial.print(lampStatus);
    Serial.print(",");
    Serial.print(lampBrightness);
    Serial.print(",");
    Serial.print(motion);
    Serial.print(",");
    Serial.println(ambientLight);
    
    // output: lampStatus,lampBrightness,motion,ambientLight

  Using a python script the data is logged automaticaly into a csv file

  ## 3) ML Training

    model.fit(X_train, y_train)  # Predicts "turn on lamp?" (0/1)

  ## 4) Depployment

  flash trained model onto the ESP32 for real time decisions

  ðŸŒŸ Future Goals

  * Integrate WiFi for remote monitoring
  * Add MQTT for cloud logging
  * Energy-saving mode (dim during low-usage hours)

  ### Why Itâ€™s Cool

* No more fumbling for switches â€” the lamp anticipates your needs.
* Self-learning â€” improves accuracy over time.
